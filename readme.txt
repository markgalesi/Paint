Paint
An interactive game where the objective is to gain as much money as possible
and build a larger storefront. Everything except the act of painting is text.
I made this small game as my final project my senior year of highschool.

How to run:Compile all of the .java files and run artStoreClient

How to Play:To interact with the menu, choose an option by typing the ascociated number and hitting enter.
The objective of the game is to make money and grow your store, the player begins with $300. The first step is to add a painting to your portfolio 
by choosing 'Add a Painting', once you enter a name, the canvas and a toolbar will pop up. Choose a color by clicking, and click and drag to put paint
on the canvas, each pixel of color on the canvas will cost money, the exact value of each color is displayed on the toolbar, some colors are
free, clear the canvas by clicking 'clear', and finish your work by clicking finish, or exit to cancel. Once you hit finish, the cost of materials for
your painting will be displayed, and your current balance will also be displayed. Once you have paintings in your portfolio, you can begin a new day and 
customers will enter your store, to sell, choose 'Sell a painting', each customer is represented by a name and will either
undrestimate, or overestimate the value of your painting, but, customers who tend to overpay, also tend to have lower budgets, the tendencies
and budget of each character will remain consistent throughout the game, so learning each customers name and habbits will benefit the player. The max 
number of paintings you can store and the number of customers to be inside your shop at one time can be upgraded by selecting 'upgrade'
